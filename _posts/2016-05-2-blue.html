description: An endless search for a place that is not greener, but perhaps blue, in the hope of a lasting transcendence. It's not quite a linear journey but one that leads you into a state of bewildermentâ€”a place somewhere in between, where meaning collapses and instead heightens the inability to apply logic in a sequential pattern. Perhaps the search is futile and in its place an acceptance of knowing "not instead of here, but more than here" is where I want to go. Knowing that I will perhaps carry a fragment of the search wherever I may go.<br/>(exhibited at the 2016 Graduate Degree Exhibition of Cranbrook Academy of Art)<br/>(special thanks to pd rearick, gabby carboni, andrea eis, steve coy, fernando bales, jon geiger and maxim safioulline)
