        <p>An endless search for a place that is not greener, but perhaps blue, in the hope of a lasting transcendence. It's not quite a linear journey but one that leads you into a state of bewildermentâ€”a place somewhere in between, where meaning collapses and instead heightens the inability to apply logic in a sequential pattern. Perhaps the search is futile and in its place an acceptance of knowing "not instead of here, but more than here" is where I want to go. Knowing that I will perhaps carry a fragment of the search wherever I may go.</p>
