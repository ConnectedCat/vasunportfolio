            <p>In the act of repeating what was performed yesterday and the day before there lies, a physically unbearable boredom. This repetitive motion is not meditative for me, but frustrating and tedious that triggers the desire for excitement. It is in this space between—the monotone of the everyday and the desire for that adrenaline rush—where I seek for the sensuality of the everyday. The tactility of materials found in my immediate environment drives me to try and create Dionysian forms that capture the sensual touch I feel when making them. I find captivating, the excessiveness of the complex characters of Pilar Ternera from Márquez’s 100 years of Solitude and Adele Bloch-Bauer immortalized in Klimt’s paintings. They become muses for my work. My work takes a mechanical route and anxiously awaits a deviation; a transformation of the painful into the sensual and the everyday into the extraordinary. The magic of the mechanical is it’s dramatic ending, at which point the units have built a fluid, malleable mass that bends and folds itself into titillating forms. With the linearity and repetition in the masses that echo the cyclical nature of our mundanity, I hope to create a base line connection with the viewer but also allowing enough zig-zags into the past and future.</p>
            <p>This is the lens through which I approach my practice, my tool to view the world.</p>
