    			<h1>Vasun Pachisia</h1>
				<p>Vasun Pachisia was born in India and moved to the U.S at the age of eighteen. She studied Graphic Design at Parsons, the New School for Design after which she continued her practice with studios such as Office of Paul Sahre, MoMA Design Studio and Ralph Applebaum Associates in New York City. Her work very often employs typography, sound and color to evoke a sensorial response from the audience. She recieved her MFA from Cranbrook Academy of Art in 2016. Her work has been exhibited at Beijing Design Festival and Crabrook Art Museum. Vasun has also been featured on various online publications such as Itâ€™s Nice That, Ficciones Typografika and Women of Graphic Design.</p>
				<p>In her latest work Blue, she provokes the desire for a physical and sensual touch with a compelling combination of color and materiality.  The act of caressing the blue is a metaphor for the endless search for transcendence in the unknown.</p>
